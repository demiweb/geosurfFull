                            in the dark. I mean this in the sense of media buyers’ ability to actually see their ads on
                            the properties they bought digital real estate on, as well as the ability to see which

                            out, the Internet is an international place. Whether you’re an affiliate marketer or you’re
                            looking to promote your own business, it pays to have a global perspective. How your website
                            looks in Louisiana may not be the same as how it looks in Laos. Offering a simple way for
                            you to get this worldwide viewpoint is GeoSurf. The idea is that you can get the “local
                            perspective” from many different local areas. Over the course of this review, we’ll see how
                            it works, how well it works, and whether it’s worth your investment.</p>
